# Quiz-Me

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Unfortunatley have still have much to learn and have only managed to meet a small fraction of the required acceptance criteria. As you can see, i was able to constuct the html and css but the script.js is still lacking. I have chosen to submit what I have in order to meet the deadline, at least.
